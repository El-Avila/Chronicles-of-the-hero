# Chronicles-of-the-hero
Chronicles-of-the-hero is a simple fighting game created, alongside my friend and collegemate Derick (@Derick1337), as part of a college project with the purpose of putting OOP concepts into practice.
## Main functionalities:
* **Local PvP**: The game in its simplicity provides a comeback to the classic local PvP experience.
* **Interactive initial menu**: An initial menu that presents some options before the player starts the game itself.
* **Pause Menu**: A way to fully stop the game at any needed moment, besides offering a way to return to the main menu.
* **Combat Mechanics**: Both players hold a sword and can hit each other in any direction.
* **Game Loop**: The purpose of each player is to defeat one another in a best-out-of-three-round system.
* **Winner Screen**: After one of the players reaches two wins the game match ends and shows up on the screen an image with a blinking effect, presenting who the winner is.
## Technologies:
* Python
* Pyxel library
## How to execute:
* Clone the repository to your local computer.
* Execute the code in a proper IDE.
* Play and enjoy with a friend.
## Main goals and learnings:
* Python knowledge put into practice.
* Consolidation of my OOP paradigm skills.
* First experience in the game design world.
* Experience in a coworking project.
